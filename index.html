                                  <p> Hi! I'm Tyree </p> 
  <p> I am student at Thinkful, and I'm from Harlem, New York.</p>
  <p> My goal as student developer is to graduate Thinkful and take my career in software engineering further. </p>
  
  <ul>
  <li> Build a career in computer programming </li> 
  <li> Build a App </li>
  <li> Master and one day teach coding </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2> ABout Me </h2>
  <p> I first felt interested in coding when I saw a few videos on Youtube and developers would be switching a Chrome OS to a Linux, Windows, or Mac. Although I practiced coding and was passionate about it I had no idea what I was doing. I later became a Field
    Technician Engineer, I used code to troubleshoot and diagnose problems and then used code that was tought to me by my peers to fix the problem and if that did not work I would dismantle the device go in and replace the the hardware.</p>
